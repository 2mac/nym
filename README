nym
===

A Unix-style program for creating acronyms and initialisms.

nym reads text input from stdin and writes the initials of the input to
stdout.

    $ echo "the world's worst superhero squad name" | nym
    TWWSSN

To Build
--------

nym uses the GNU build process:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
	$ make

To Install
----------

After building (see above):

    # make install

Hacking
-------

nym uses the GNU coding style for C with a strict 79-column limit in the source
code. Indentations are two spaces, and tab characters are eight spaces. It is
polite to use a tab character any time eight spaces would be used in an
indentation, but it is not required.
